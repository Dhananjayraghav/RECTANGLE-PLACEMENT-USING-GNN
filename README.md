# RECTANGLE-PLACEMENT-USING-GNN
The goal of this assignment is to optimally place 9 rectangles within a bin of dimensions 80 by 40 while adhering to specific constraints.
Key Constraints:
Rectangles 1 & 2: Must be placed at the top and bottom of the bin, respectively.
Rectangle 3: Should be positioned close to rectangles 4, 5, and 9.
Rectangle 7: Needs to be near rectangles 6 and 2.
Remaining Rectangles: Can be placed optimally anywhere within the bin while maintaining a one-unit separation between them.
